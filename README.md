# CRM Data Visualization Project
CRM Performance Monitor for Company X 

## Description

The goal of this project was to take CRM data for a specific year and understand how Company X performed overall in terms of total net new annual revenue for the year 2017 from March to December.

Company X wanted to dig into what product series was the best selling, what products within each series over performed, what sectors were the most common in closed won deals, how each month and quarter compared to each other regarding total revenue, and how different teams across the sales department performed. 

Company X also wanted to test how close won rates changed in 2017 and whether or not the assumed 30% close rate was still the close rate across the sales department given this year’s performance. This project performs a Binomial Test to determine if close rates have changed. Another key question is whether a customer’s sector and the product series they purchase are dependent to understand how to market and tailor sales case studies for each product series. A Chi-squared test of independence was conducted.
